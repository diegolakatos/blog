      <description>&lt;p&gt;While ago while working in a pipeline that was going to be used to create resources on AWS I faced a strange situation that led me to an interesting troubleshooting path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scenario was quite simple, an EC2 instance acting as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/&#34;&gt;gitlab-runner&lt;/a&gt; executing a docker container that would download some terraform code from our git repository and run &lt;code&gt;terraform apply&lt;/code&gt;. The EC2 instance had an IAM role attached that with all the necessary permissions to create the resources defined on the Terraform code.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When working with kubernetes the standard way to create objects such as pods, deployments and services is to create a yaml manifest file that describes the desired state and then use &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; to create/update the object.
Althought, straightforward this process might create a barrier for developers and operations teams that now have to mantain a new codebase in a new &amp;ldquo;language&amp;rdquo;. YAML is easy to read but troubleshooting it might be difficult due the need for correct identation and the errors that are exibithed by &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; might not be easily understood.
If a team is already using Terraform to create and manage the infrastructure it makes sense to use it to create the objects inside kubernetes as well, this brings some advantages such as:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
